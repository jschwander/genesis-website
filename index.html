            <p class="subheadline">Construction costs have doubled. Productivity hasn't budged. Builders still profit from inefficiency—because cost-plus contracts reward more hours, not better outcomes. Genesis applies proven systems thinking—used by manufacturing giants—to eliminate waste, align incentives, and deliver faster, more cost-effective buildings without compromise.</p>

                    For over 60 years, construction has operated under outdated models. Cost-plus and billable-hour contracts reward builders for maximizing time and expense—not delivering results.

                    The consequences are clear: U.S. construction productivity has stagnated since the 1940s, while costs have surged. Builders make more money by doing things the long way.
                    
                    Today's planning, design, and cost management processes remain fragmented, inefficient, and archaic—especially when compared to industries like manufacturing and retail. And while new technologies and "lean" initiatives promise progress, they often just add more layers of complexity and cost.
                    
                    The result? Buildings now cost nearly twice what material and labor inflation alone can explain.
