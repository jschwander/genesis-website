HOW TO UPDATE YOUR BLOG

After publishing a new post in Sanity, you need to run the script that creates the HTML file.

There are two ways to do this:

METHOD 1: FROM TERMINAL (RECOMMENDED)
1. Open Terminal
2. Type or copy/paste:
   cd ~/Desktop/Website
   ./generate-blog-posts.sh

METHOD 2: USING SCRIPT EDITOR
1. Open Script Editor (search for it in Spotlight)
2. Open the file "Generate Blog Posts.scpt" in the Website folder
3. Click the "Run" button (triangle play button)

The script will connect to Sanity, find all your blog posts, and create HTML files 
for any new posts automatically.

REMEMBER: You must run this script each time you publish a new post in Sanity.
