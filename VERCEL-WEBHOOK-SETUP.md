# Setting Up Automatic Blog Post Generation with Vercel & Sanity

This guide will help you set up your website to automatically generate blog post HTML files whenever you publish a post in Sanity.

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name like "Sanity Blog Webhook"
4. Select these scopes: `repo` (full control of repositories)
5. Click "Generate token" and **copy the token** (you'll only see it once!)

## Step 2: Configure Vercel Environment Variables

1. Log in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
2. Select your Genesis website project
3. Go to "Settings" > "Environment Variables"
4. Add a new environment variable:
   - **Name**: `GITHUB_TOKEN`
   - **Value**: Paste the GitHub token you created in Step 1
5. Make sure to set it for "Production" and "Preview" environments
6. Click "Save"

## Step 3: Deploy Your Website to Vercel

1. Push this code to GitHub (or GitLab/BitBucket)
2. Your site should automatically deploy on Vercel
3. If not already deployed, you can manually trigger a deploy from the Vercel dashboard

## Step 4: Set Up Sanity Webhook

1. Log in to your [Sanity management console](https://manage.sanity.io)
2. Navigate to your project
3. Go to API â†’ Webhooks
4. Click "Create webhook"
5. Fill in the following details:
   - **Name**: "Blog Post HTML Generator"
   - **URL**: `https://your-vercel-site.com/api/sanity-webhook` (replace with your actual Vercel domain)
   - **Dataset**: "production"
   - **Filter**: `_type == "post" && published`
   - **Projection**: `{"documentId": _id, "type": "post.published"}`
   - **HTTP method**: POST
   - **HTTP Headers**: Add a header `x-webhook-secret` with value `genesis-sanity-webhook`
   - Check "Enable webhook"
6. Click "Save"

## Step 5: Test the Webhook

1. Edit or create a post in Sanity
2. Publish the post
3. Check your Vercel logs to see if the webhook was triggered
4. Check your GitHub repository - a new commit should appear with the HTML file

## Understanding How It Works

1. When you publish a post in Sanity, it sends a webhook to your Vercel function
2. The Vercel function fetches the post data from Sanity
3. It generates HTML content for the post
4. It commits the HTML file directly to your GitHub repository
5. GitHub notifies Vercel of the new commit
6. Vercel automatically deploys the updated site with the new blog post

## Troubleshooting

If posts aren't being generated automatically:

1. Check the Vercel function logs in the Vercel dashboard
2. Make sure your GitHub token has the correct permissions
3. Verify the webhook is configured correctly in Sanity
4. Check that the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable is set in Vercel

## Security Note

For production use:
1. Consider using a GitHub App instead of a personal access token for better security
2. Change the webhook secret in `api/sanity-webhook.js` to a strong random string
3. Update the same secret in the Sanity webhook configuration
